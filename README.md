# Physical-Models
#### A library of mathematical models for the solution to physics problems.
## 1. **Ball bounces on sphere**
### **Build Status: Working model, under development**
##### The physics of a ball, or series of balls, dropping onto a sphere is simulated in this code.

###### The User may select the radius and elesticity of the falling ball as it collidfed with the sphere.
###### Generally the sphere should be significantly larger than the falling ball, however the User may feel free to experiment.
###### Once the criteria for the ball and sphere are defined, the User may click with the mouse on the screen to generate a ball, which will descend subject to gravitational for and collision with the sphere.
###### There is no limit to the quantity of balls which may be produced.
